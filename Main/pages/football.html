        <p>Football is my favourite hobby. Itâ€™s a team
            sport, in which you can score only by placing
            the ball inside the goal of the opposite team.<br />
            Teams content 11 players â€“ field players and a
            goalkeeper. The goalkeeperâ€™s role is to protect
            the goal. <br />Heâ€™s the only person that can touch
            the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty
            area. There are also 3 men which are not
            playing, these are the refferees.</p>
        <p> Personally I play football for both training and
            fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
            technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
            condition.<br /> Additionaly scoring a goal or
            blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
            feeling, what makes football a good game for
            minimizing the stress.</p>
        <p> While playing, you must remember that
            football is a team game. Individual actions
            may be satisfying, but thereâ€™s more pleasure
            from the game when you remember about the
            teamwork.<br /> Moreover playing as a team is
            much more effective, and when thereâ€™s
            chemistry between the teammates, you can
            beat stronger or even more skilled oponents.<br />
            Football is based on teamwork and thatâ€™s the
            best part of it in my opinion.</p>

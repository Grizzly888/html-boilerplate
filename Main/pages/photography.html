            <h3>Photography Can Help You Capture Memories</h3>
            <img src="../images/child.jpg" alt="Moment" style="width:500px">
            <p>Knowing how to use your camera in any situation is a superpower. You can use this ability to document
                your life and capture beautiful pictures wherever you like.<br />

                The more you work on these abilities, the more youâ€™ll improve. You can think of it as a constant cycle
                of personal development.<br />

                Make sure that you experiment with lots of genres. You can start with <a
                    href="https://expertphotography.com/types-of-landscape-photography/">landscape</a>, <a
                    href="https://expertphotography.com/what-is-a-macro-lens/">macro</a>, <a
                    href="https://expertphotography.com/best-camera-for-portraits/">portrait</a>, and
                <a href="https://expertphotography.com/candid-street-photography/">street</a> photography. The more
                skills you develop, the more confident youâ€™ll feel.</p>

            <h3>You Can Express Yourself in New Ways</h3>
            <img src="../images/express.jpg" alt="express yourself" style="width:500px">
            <p>Every art form has its unique advantages. Even if youâ€™re already an artist or love working on DIY
                projects, youâ€™re bound to discover something new in photography.<br />

                Photography as a hobby can be instantly gratifying, especially if you find the perfect moment to
                capture. It can challenge you in many ways, depending on the genre you choose.<br />

                For example, macro photography can help you notice more beauty in details.</p>

            <h3>You Can Connect With a Whole World of New People</h3>
            <img src="../images/people.jpg" alt="Socialising" style="width:500px">
            <p>The photography community is very large and diverse. There are Facebook groups, Instagram pages, and
                international meet-ups for photographers.<br />

                If youâ€™re an absolute beginner, you could find it helpful to join a specific group for beginners in
                portraiture, for example. You can also reach out to your favourite photographers and ask for advice when
                you feel lost.<br />

                Being a part of a group will make you feel important, supported, and involved. It might also help you
                get through creative blocks and make you more comfortable with the idea of sharing your work online.</p>

            <h3>Taking Photos Might Inspire You to Go out More Often</h3>
            <img src="../images/out.jpg" alt="Walking" style="width:500px">
            <p>Spending more time outside for yourself is rarely a bad idea.

                No matter what you decide to photograph, youâ€™ll probably have to go outside to have a photoshoot.<br />
                You
                might have a specific location in mind you want to shoot in, a friend youâ€™d like to have a photoshoot
                with or any other motivation.<br />

                Photography as a hobby can bring more excitement to your life. Youâ€™ll be more active, more creative, and
                more knowledgeable about photography.<br />

                Youâ€™ll also become more aware of whatâ€™s going on outside of your usual routine.</p>

            <h3>Youâ€™ll Be a Lifelong Photography Student</h3>
            <img src="../images/student.jpg" alt="student" style="width:500px">
            <p>There are many experienced photographers out there, but there is always room for more improvement.<br />

                Youâ€™ll always discover more things to learn and understand in photography. This could be anything from
                new photography camera equipment to new shooting techniques.<br />

                Being a lifelong photography student doesnâ€™t mean taking tests for the rest of your life. It means that
                no matter how much you learn, there will always be something new to inspire and motivate you.<br />

                This will inevitably make your photography journey an endless and exciting one.

            <h3>You Can Make Some Extra Money by Selling Your Photos Online or Having Photoshoots</h3>
            <img src="../images/money.jpg" alt="Dog and a child" style="width:500px">
            <p>Hobbies need to be relaxing and fulfilling, so money isnâ€™t every hobbyistâ€™s top priority. However, you
                can earn some extra money when you have even a little photography experience.</p>
